ABSTARCT 

This article deals with the issue of using punctuation marks correctly. The misuse of 
punctuation marks affects meaning; therefore, it affects translation. As a result, the writer 
should pay more attention to punctuation marks and not to use them randomly. 
Simultaneously, the reader has to take care of the punctuation marks when interpreting a 
certain text for translation. The article tackles the jobs done by punctuation marks such as the 
use of the comma to set off nonessential information, the comma to set off interrupters, the 
comma separating direct-address expressions, the comma with short introductory statements 
and the comma before a relative pronoun. Moreover, the difficulties caused by lack of a 
comma will be discussed. The problematic use of comma before "and" will be handled. Cases 
in which no comma is needed in the target language will be provided. The current article 
provides some practical and illustrative examples, especially the comma and the full stop. 
Translation from English into Arabic and vice versa is considered.

1. Introduction 


Punctuation plays a vital role in the interpretation of a certain text. So using it haphazardly 
leads to misunderstanding the text and consequently the wrong translation. There are many 
differences between languages with regard to punctuation marks, particularly Arabic and 
English, which have to be taken into consideration by translators. 

In order to realize the importance of punctuation, consider the following string of words 
with various punctuation marks. Try to decide what they are supposed to mean and the effect 
of the changed meaning on translation. Examples are taken from Trask (1997 :3) with some 
modifications. What is the problem in each sentence? 


Example 1: We had one problem: only Adel knew we faced bankruptcy. 
Example 2: We had one problem only: Adel knew we faced bankruptcy. 
Example 3: We had one problem only, Adel knew: we faced bankruptcy . 
Example 4: We had one problem only Adel knew we faced: bankruptcy. 


The underlined text is the problem in each sentence. Following are translations of the 
previous example: 


1 i, ^jl j VI 3.1^1 j A IS -a V) I ^ 7*' jJ ; 1 tJliLa 

jjc. JaIc- (ji VI V! l'ig >1 ;2 

j VI 3-l^lj A IS. -a V| Uft?.l jj Ajl tjjlc. ^ic. ;3 

.t^VliVI j VI 3.1^. j (JaIe- a^^lj A IS -a lli^l j tJlLa 


Based on the above Arabic translation, it became clear the use of different punctuation 
marks in one sentence leads to different meanings. 
To attract and keep the reader’s serious attention, the writer must write and punctuate 
correctly. "Too many stops and commas make the text look spotty" is a wrong remark that 
ignores the proper function of punctuation. The following example will refute it. 

Example 5: 1 have taken several science courses this year; my favorite was neuroscience. 
Example 6: 1 have taken several science courses this year, but my favorite was neuroscience. 

In Example 5, the semicolon (;) is used primarily to join two closely related independent 
clauses in a single sentence. When using a semicolon to join clauses, make sure they are 
independent; that is, they can stand alone as sentences. On the other hand, in Example 6, the 
two clauses are joined with the conjunction but. This changes the meaning slightly from the 
previous version; it emphasizes the contrast between the group of courses in the first clause 
and the single course in the second clause. As a result of the change in meaning, the Arabic 
translation will be different as follows: 

t l—lL. j ^cd! ^ic. LgAjJaSl J t'CLaLd! i .ll-ld! t^aljd! I A j!.l<i .id ;5 ijddi 

t i. — ll . ^ir. V ' j ^cd! IfrL *a3l j 4 A_ia 1*JI .ll-ld! t^aljd! !i& j!.l<i di] \() iJILg 

2. The Jobs of Punctuation Marks 

Punctuation marks are integral parts of writing. They do two jobs. One is grammatical and 
the other is rhetorical (Kirkman, 2006). 

• Grammatical: they show where the boundaries are meant to be between segments of larger 
statements, and how segments of text are meant to relate to each other. Here is an example 
that illustrates the boundary-marking role: 

Example 7: Executors delay giving information about substantial deviations from agreed 
dates. Because of this action cannot be taken in time. 


The reader mis-reads that statement at first, since he/she reads " Because of this action " as a 
group; but then he/she realized that the group at the beginning of the second sentence was 
intended to be just "Because of this". If the writer had supplied a comma at the meaning- 
boundary between "this" and "action", the reader should not have been misled as follows: 


Example 8: Executors delay giving information about substantial deviations from agreed 
dates. Because of this, action cannot be taken in time. 


V !i& (jV d-g-dc. JjlLd! .lie.! j^d! ^3 o^jdaadl :7 JE- 

ciis ^]! ^9 ALkj! 


s/ t^iklj]! lias i d c.A~ (JjdLd! ije! j-d! o^jdaadl da! jjL^di! djtdaj CliLo ^jdij dj^ ^d-u-d! ;8 ddLo 

ci is _jl! ?.! j^.1 dLkj! 


In the same vein, the reader should note how punctuation marks signal the relations 
between segments of text in the following statements: 

Example 9: Take no action as the camera operates automatically ... (The as ... group tells us 
when) 


3 
Example 10: Take no action, as the camera operates automatically ... (The as ... group tells us 
why) 

The words in the previous two statements are exactly the same, but the relations between 
the words change in accordance with whether a comma is present or absent. 

Lulaii/ljjljs LoAic- ' ‘ij JxAj ;9 Jli« 

lulili/liiljl Jaxj I lllA. JxAj V ; IQ JLLa 

• Rhetorical: they show the emphasis or tone the writer wants to give to a word or word- 
group. 

The next three examples illustrate the rhetorical job done by punctuation marks. Note how 
they signal the emphasis or tone the writer wants to give a word or word-group - information 
which, if we were speaking, we would express by inflections of voice: 

Example 11: This is known as exact replacement of the old medicine. 

Example 12: You must report the burglary to the police. 

Example 13: Rescue parties were sent out immediately AFTER the avalanche. 


.^aJAjill d jAII LgLgj ^ L ^ JjAj !a& ; 1 1 JLLa 

^ 4_iIaxj a_l J£ ■ ^ ‘ . '7* J 12 JLLa 

jLig-N! (adE A^yj j) Axj aIINI CllLjjjf :13 JLLa 
As all these examples show, punctuation marks (including the use of italics, underlining 
and capital letters) are vital parts of our signaling system. They are not just optional extras. 

Punctuation marks have been introduced rather recently into the Arabic writing system. 
Arabic writers shift between ideas using conjugating conjunctions instead of punctuation 
marks. In Modem Standard Arabic (MSA), however, due to the influence if translation 
which, to some extent, transfers punctuation marks from the target languages, and due to the 
tendency of modem writers to use punctuation marks more consistently, Arabic has come to 
see more punctuation. Yet, even in modern writing, it is rather impossible to rely on the 
period, for example, as a demarcation of the sentence boundary (Attia, 2004). 

Punctuation marks facilitate reading as they guide the reader to the appropriate meaning as 
shown in the following instances: 


.id?- j!' La ; 1 4 JLLa 
!j^^)]| 4 ■ - ^ ' La ; 15 JLLa 
ypaAi La ; 15 JLLa 

Example 14: The man did not do well. 

Example 15: How handsome the man is! 

Example 16: What did the man do well? 

Based on the use of punctuation marks in the previous examples, the first sentence is a 
statement, the second an exclamation and the third a question. Thus, the punctuation mark 
makes a difference to meaning in target and source languages.

Following are the different uses of the comma and the full-stop and how they affect 
meaning accordingly. 

3. Comma 

As with all punctuation, the most important reason to place a comma is to clarify the 
meaning of the sentence. There is a world of difference between sentences with and without 
commas (Woods, 2006) as follows: 

Example 17: Ahmed tipped Hani because he appreciated good service. 

Example 18: Ahmed tipped, Hani, because he appreciated good service. 

In the first sentence Ahmed tipped someone named Hani. In the second, Hani is being 
addressed, and the reader does not know whom Ahmed tipped — a waiter, a taxi driver, or a 
housecleaner. Ahmed may even have tipped Hani himself. The translation into Arabic may 
be: 


*El.liJI jAjL 1 1 . : .~.q ] tir- 1 ; Y~j ij LlA 

*La.lkll jAii AjV 1 ^ -'A ;aAA AaAI (ji Li ^ic-l ; 1 3 

In the following sentences, the separation created by commas radically changes the 
meaning of the second sentence: 

Example 19: Students who are obnoxious should be disciplined firmly. 

Example 20: Students, who are obnoxious, should be disciplined firmly. 
...
Example 68: When the film was developed, none of the pictures proved satisfactory.
